# Thero: AI-Powered Carbon Credit Validator

## 1. Problem Statement
Carbon credit projects in Africa—particularly those in clean energy and land-use sectors—face major barriers to verification and certification.  
- **High verification costs:** Traditional audits rely on manual inspections, field surveys, and international consultants, often costing tens of thousands of dollars.  
- **Data gaps:** Smallholder farmers, NGOs, and startups lack the technical expertise and infrastructure to track carbon impact effectively.  
- **Limited market access:** Without verified credits, projects cannot access global carbon markets, losing out on potential financing opportunities.  

As a result, **many African projects fail to qualify** for carbon credits, despite delivering real climate benefits.

## 2. Solution
**Thero** is an AI-powered platform that simplifies and automates carbon credit validation.  

- **Satellite & Drone Data Integration:** Uses publicly available satellite data (e.g., Sentinel, Landsat) and drone imagery to track biomass growth, land use, and renewable energy infrastructure.  
- **AI Carbon Estimation Models:** Machine learning models estimate CO₂ captured or avoided, creating verifiable data trails.  
- **Simplified User Platform:** NGOs, farmers, and startups log their project activities (tree planting, clean cooking stoves, solar installations, etc.) into an intuitive dashboard.  
- **Verification API:** Data packages are formatted in compliance with global standards (e.g., Verra, Gold Standard) and can be shared directly with certifiers.  

This dramatically **lowers costs**, **reduces time to market**, and **empowers small actors** to participate in the carbon economy.

## 3. Target Users
- **NGOs & Community Projects** → running tree planting, clean cooking, or solar programs.  
- **Farmers & Smallholders** → benefiting from agroforestry and clean energy adoption.  
- **Carbon Certifiers** → using Thero to streamline audits.  
- **Startups & Enterprises** → deploying clean tech solutions across Africa.

## 4. How It Works
1. **Onboarding:** Project registers on the platform, uploads baseline data.  
2. **Data Collection:** Satellite + drone imagery + local logs feed into the system.  
3. **AI Processing:** Model estimates CO₂ captured/avoided over time.  
4. **Credit-Ready Reports:** Automated compliance reports generated for certifiers.  
5. **Verification:** Certifiers access data through Thero, reducing manual verification.

## 5. Competitive Advantage
- **Cost Reduction:** Cuts verification costs by up to 70%.  
- **Accessibility:** Opens carbon markets to projects previously excluded.  
- **Transparency:** Immutable digital records for credibility.  
- **Scalability:** Works across forestry, agriculture, and clean energy projects.

## 6. Market Opportunity
The global carbon credit market is projected to grow to **$250B by 2030**. Africa holds **60% of the world’s uncultivated arable land** and massive renewable energy potential, but less than **5% of African projects currently access carbon markets**.  
**Thero unlocks this latent potential.**

## 7. Status & Next Steps
- **MVP Development:** AI model integration with open-source satellite data.  
- **Pilot Projects:** Partnerships with NGOs and clean energy startups.  
- **Investor Ask:** Funding to build platform infrastructure, acquire drone datasets, and onboard first 1,000 projects.

## 8. Vision
A future where **every African clean energy or land-use project can easily validate its carbon impact**, access global markets, and secure sustainable financing.

**Thero = Climate Impact Made Verifiable.**
